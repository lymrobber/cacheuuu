# IoTgo Arduino Library

## Documentation

Online API documentation can be reached at <http://docs.iteadstudio.com/IoTgo-ino/>.

Offline API documentation can be found under directory `doc/`.

## How to get started

On the homepage of API documentation, the tabs of Modules, Classes and Examples 
will be useful for Arduino developers. 

## Levels

IoTgo Arduino Library has levels following:

  - IoTgo Device Level: Switch/Light/THSensor [source: Dev_*]
  - Http Proxy Level: IoTgo [source: IoTgo*]
  - Ethernet Level: ESP2560(WIFI) [source: Eth_*]
  - Hardware Level: WBoard/UNO/MEGA

# Configuration and Connection

## Configure Your Board

When you use with UNO board, uncomment the follow line in `Eth_ESP8266.h`.

	#define UNO

When you use with MEGA board or WBoard, uncomment the follow line in `Eth_ESP8266.h`.

	#define MEGA

## Connection

### UNO

When you use it with UNO board, the connection should be like these:

	ESP8266_TX->D0

	ESP8266_RX->D1

	ESP8266_CHPD->3.3V

	ESP8266_VCC->3.3V

	ESP8266_GND->GND

	//The baud rate of software serial can't be higher that 19200, so we use software serial as a debug port
	FTDI_RX->D3			

	FTDI_TX->D2

### MEGA

When you use it with MEGA board, the connection should be like these:

	ESP8266_TX->RX1(D19)

	ESP8266_RX->TX1(D18)

	ESP8266_CH_PD->3.3V

	ESP8266_VCC->3.3V

	ESP8266_GND->GND

When you want to output the debug information, please use DebugSerial. For example,

	DebugSerial.println("hello");

### WBoard

Need no connections.

# Attention

**Note1**:	The size of message from ESP8266 is too big for arduino sometimes, 
so the library can't receive the whole buffer because the size of the hardware 
serial buffer which is defined in HardwareSerial.h is too small.

Open the file from `\arduino\hardware\arduino\avr\cores\arduino\HardwareSerial.h`.
See the follow line in the HardwareSerial.h file.

	#define SERIAL_BUFFER_SIZE 64

The default size of the buffer is 64. Change it into a bigger number, like 256 
or more.

The SRAM size of mega is bigger than UNO's, so it is better to use MEGA board to
communicate with ESP8266.
